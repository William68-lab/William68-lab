## Hi there 👋
Hi, I'm Wei, a Bachelor student in Electrical Engineering at NCHU.   
Here are some of the projects I have completed during my courses.


### About Me
- 🎓 NCHU EE (Digital IC Design)
- 🛠️ Verilog / SystemVerilog / Vivado / Vitis HLS / AXI / DMA / PYNQ-ZU
- 🔭 Project: ORB-SLAM3 corner detection acceleration (FAST / Harris / NMS / Octree on FPGA)
- 
### What I'm Working On
- ✅ Harris/FAST corner detection ➜ AXI-DMA (SG) streaming ➜ ORBextractor integration  
- 🚀 Timing & resource optimization: II=1, URAM/BRAM balance, 100–200 MHz closure  
- 📊 Accuracy & performance: Precision / Recall / F1, automated CPU baseline comparison
